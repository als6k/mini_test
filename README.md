## What is focus?

Focus determines where keyboard events go in the page at any given moment. For
instance, if you focus a text input field and begin typing, the input field
receives the keyboard events and displays the characters you type. While it has
focus, it will also receive pasted input from the clipboard.

The currently focused item is often indicated by a *focus ring*, the style of
which depends on both the browser and on any styling the page author has
applied. Chrome, for instance, typically highlights focused elements with a blue
border, whereas Firefox uses a dashed border.

Some users operate their computer almost entirely with the keyboard or other
input device. For those users, focus is critical; it's their primary means of
reaching everything on the screen. For that reason, the Web AIM checklist states
in section 2.1.1 that [all page functionality should be available using the
keyboard](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc2.1.1){: .external },
unless it's something you cannot do with a keyboard, such as freehand drawing.
